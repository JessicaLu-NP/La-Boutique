La Boutique

We chose e commerce for the project. It is a fashion shopping site that allows you to get rewards through luck after checkout. it could be a discount of up to ~60%.

Design Process

This website is for people who want to have the convenience of shopping for clothes at the comfort of their own home, my site allows them to do that.

User Stories

    As a student, I want to buy a dress online, so that I can wear something nice to prom.

Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact Us" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
